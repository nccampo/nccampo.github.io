CODE DESCRIPTION:
    This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and image files needed to create a static personal portfolio through HTML. It effectively displays personal information about the developer as well as his previous projects and skills.

THINGS YOU DID IN THE CODE:
    To create the content of the webpage, HTML 5 was used. Moreover, a style.css file was created to create an external stylesheet that is linked in the HTML file. The images attached were created through Canva.

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED:
    Personally the challenges that I have encountered are the difficulties in pushing in the git repository. Additionally, the syntax of HTML and CSS in formatting an element of the webpage is quite overwhelming but this problem was solved with the help of online resources.
