Exercise #9: React JS Part 2

Code Description:
    The code is an implementation of a shopping app 'Lazado' using ReactJS. In this code, componetization were used to allow for code reusability and avoid redundancy. Additionally, the code is dynamic enough to respond and append a new item when a new product is inserted in the menu item object array. Lastly, when add to cart is clicked, the console will print out what product has been added to cart.
    To add, building on top of exer 8, this ReactJS application now utilizes state management and event handling by creating a new component - shopping cart. Shopping cart is append cart items when add button is clicked which returns a list of items with its respectivve quantities. A delete button is present in order to decrement the number of items in the shopping cart.
